# CMake ExternalProject Demos

This repo demos CMake ExternalProject. 
The top-level directory is simply used by our 
[cmakeutils](https://github.com/scivision/cmakeutils)
repo as the external project.

The directory [rebuild](./rebuild) is separately used to examine issues of external projects always rebuilding.
